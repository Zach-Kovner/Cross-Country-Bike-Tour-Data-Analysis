# Cross-Country Bike Tour Data Analysis
## Overview 
In the summer of 2025, I began a journey from my home in Washington, D.C. to school in Seattle, WA. Over the course of 3,300 miles and nearly 2 months, I collected tens of thousands of data points on my Garmin watch, including posiition, speed, heart rate, elevation, temperature, and other key metrics. **This project turns that real-world data into meaningful insights and interpretable visuals through Python.**

## Goal
The overarching goal of this project was to use machine learning to predict into the future and extend the trajectory of my journey. Through analysis of the data, I found meaningful correlation between my independent variable, time (measured in days), and a multitude of dependant variables, which ultimately allowed me to build a linear model which could predict results of future days with data from previous days. 

## Skills & Tools
I applied principles of:
- data cleaning
- data analysis
- time series forecasting
- machine learning
- data visualization
- rolling averages
  
with the use of libraries such as `pandas`,`numpy`,`matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `seaborn`, and others.
